# What is this game:

This is a classic arcade game written by Object Oriented Javascript Code contains classes of objects.
Objects includes the enemy, Player and awards. Enemies are the bugs which the player should try to pass and get to the water withouth any contact with them. The player can move with a strategy to gain some awards (gems), while the trying to get to the water.

To come up with a limit for the game, if the player's level gets to 4 there will be a message to announce he/she won the game with what score. Also, if there is any collision between the player and the enemy the whole game goes to the beginning as he/she just started the game. 

I added the option to change the character of the player by clicking the character.(Can be more, I just made it limit to 2 characters).
