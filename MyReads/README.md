# MyReads Project

* this is a small visual library app which helps to keep track of which book you want to read, already read or reading now or look for new book.

## How to start

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`



## What You're Getting



* a Backend Server which provides:
 library of books along with [`getAll`](#getall), [`update`](#update),  [`search`](#search) (to find what is available in the library, search the books and update which shelf we want them to be on.)

*  you can go to the ListPage which shows which book attracted your attention and has been added to your list and how far are you in reading them.

* by pressing the button next  to the book you move the book to the right shelf

* if you are looking for new books you can press the + button on the right bottom of the ListBook and go to the SearchPage to search for the book you might. You can enter the key query to find the book
