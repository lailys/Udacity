# Udacity Restaurant Review

## Responsive Design

###
1. I worked on the app to be responsive to all range of display sizes . Now, the content of the app can be seen correctly, with no issue on any device with any screen size.
2. Images in the site are sized appropriate to the viewport and do not crowd or overlap other elements in the browser, regardless of viewport size.
3. On the main page, restaurants and images are displayed in all viewports. The detail page includes a map, hours and reviews in all viewports.


## Accessibility

###
1. Alt text attribute has been added to all images when they are being add to the page. Now, All content-related images include appropriate alternate text that clearly describes the content of the image.

2. Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page. Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.

3. Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements. For those elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate ARIA roles are defined.



## Offline Availability

###
1. Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.
