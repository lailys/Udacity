   #this game is a memory game which on refreshing the link or reset botton you get a pick of what is on the board and after a little time the board gets clear. Game starts here and you need to remember what two cards were similar. If you are right, the cards are going to be flipped for the rest of the game. 
   
   The game comes to end when you are able to guess all the matched cards and you will be cheered by a message which congrats you on be able to finish the game and let you know the number of the moves and the duration in which you finished the game.
